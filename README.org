Inspired by guides of [[https://medium.com/faun/zero-to-hero-set-up-your-mac-for-software-development-919ede3df83b][Dirk Avery]], [[https://medium.com/better-programming/setting-up-your-mac-for-web-development-in-2020-659f5588b883][Vinicius De Antoni]], [[https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/][Sourabh Bajaj]], [[https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup][Nicolas Hery]].

This is a reminder for myself how to setup a new Mac or updating the OS, which might be useful for others. The repository includes some of my dot-files as a reference.

* How to update the OS
  There are basically two options:
  1. Reformat the startup disk and install a fresh new system, or

  2. Use /Software Update/ to update macOS on top of the existing OS.

  In both cases, a little bit of preparation helps.

** Fresh install

*** Before starting
    1. You might want to use iCloud for your /Contacts/, /Calendars/, /Reminders/, /Notes/, and /Keychain/. If you had not switched it on, you should do this a couple of hours before installation because it takes some time until things get synchronised. Some logoff/login might also help. You can check all but /Keychain/ on [[https://www.icloud.com][icloud.com]]. You can switch it off again on the updated system after synchronisation finished, if not wanted.

    1. Backup all your files including Documents, Movies, Pictures. Check the Desktop as well.

    1. Also store all your dot-files and dot-directories from the =${HOME}= directory such as =.bash_profile=, =.bashrc= and =.ssh=.

    1. You might want to write down your /Computer Name/ from /System Preferences/ > /Sharing/ (macOS <= 12) or /System Settings/ > /General/ > /Sharing/ > /Local hostname/ (macOS >= 13).

    1. You might also like to write down your username. Type in the terminal:

       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
         whoami
       #+END_SRC

    1. A list of your installed programs in /Applications/ might come in handy.

*** Make a bootable installer for macOS on USB
    From [[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372][support.apple.com]]:
    1. Download a macOS installer such as macOS Monterey from the App Store. When the macOS installer opens, quit it without continuing installation.

       The installer should have a size of about 12-16 GB. Based on your Mac, only a much smaller app might have been downloaded, which would later download the actual files during installation. This does not allow to create a bootable thumb drive. Try to get the full installer for example from the Apple Developer site.

    1. Format a USB flash drive of at least 16 GB storage as /Mac OS Extended/ with name InstallMonterey, for example.

    1. In Terminal type:

       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
         sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Monterey.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/InstallMonterey --nointeraction
       #+END_SRC

*** Installing macOS with the bootable installer
    Also from [[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372][support.apple.com]]:
    1. Startup is different if you have a Mac with Apple silicon chips or Intel processors.
       a) Intel processor
          - Connect USB drive, restart while holding Option (alt) key until you see the bootable volumes.

          - Select the volume containing the bootable installer, i.e. /Install macOS Monterey/, and press Return.

       a) Apple silicon
          - Shut down.

          - Turn on Mac and continue to hold the power button until you see the startup options window, which shows your bootable volumes.

          - Select the volume containing the bootable installer, i.e. /Install macOS Monterey/, and click Continue.

    1. Select /Disk Utility/. Choose the /Internal/ disk, e.g. /Macintosh HD/. /Erase/ it using the /Format/ APFS. Use the button /Erase Volume Group/ instead of /Erase/ if available; otherwise use /Erase/.

    1. Select any other internal volumes in the sidebar, then click the delete volume (–) button in the toolbar to delete that volume. Disregard any internal volume named Macintosh HD or Macintosh HD – Data, as well as any volumes in the External and Disk Images sections of the sidebar.

       Then quit /Disk Utility/.

    1. Select /Install macOS Monterey/ and follow the on-screen steps.

** Update via /Software Update/

*** Before starting
    1. It is always recommended to make a backup of your system before an upgrade.

    1. Update all your installed apps in /Applications/. The newest app versions will probably already be suitable for the new macOS version. It avoids the problem that you cannot open the old app version on the new macOS system anymore to do the simple update and then have to uninstall/install the app again, which might also need the licence key, etc.

       For this, open each non-Apple application and /Check for Updates.../.

       Use the /App Store.../ for all Apple programs and apps downloaded from the App Store..

    1. The /Software Update/ takes care of all your accounts, passwords, etc. The step before takes care of all the installed applications. But anything installed from the command line will (most probably) not work anymore. So I first uninstall the all things that will be installed in the steps below, which are Homebrew, LaTeX, Python/pyenv, and everything installed with install\under{}netcdf. I also set back Apple's bash shell as default (because the newer bash shell is removed together with Homebrew).

       Set Apple's bash shell as default:

       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
         chsh -s /bin/bash
       #+END_SRC

       You have to open a new login terminal so that it takes effect.

       Uninstall panoply:

       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
         brew uninstall panoply
       #+END_SRC

       Remove Homebrew:

       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
         /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"
       #+END_SRC
       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
         [[ -d /opt/homebrew ]] && rm -r /opt/homebrew
         [[ -f ${HOME}/.fzf.bash ]] && rm ${HOME}/.fzf.bash
         [[ -f ${HOME}/.fzf.zsh ]] && rm ${HOME}/.fzf.zsh
       #+END_SRC

       Remove LaTeX:

       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
         sudo rm -r /usr/local/texlive/
       #+END_SRC
       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
         sudo rm -r /Library/TeX/
       #+END_SRC

       Remove pyenv's Python versions:

       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
         rm -r ${HOME}/.pyenv
       #+END_SRC

       Remove everything under =/usr/local=. This seems extreme but Apple has nothing installed under =/usr/local=, so it comes all from you or Homebrew. You might change into =/usr/local= and remove selected directories by hand.

       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
         rm -r /usr/local/*
       #+END_SRC

*** Installing macOS via /Software Update/

    Go to /System Preferences/ > /Software Update/ (macOS <= 12) or to /System Settings/ > /General/ > /Software Update/ (macOS >= 13). Select to install the new macOS and follow the on-screen instructions.


* Setup macOS
  The steps are intent to be done (roughly) in order.

** Check for system updates
   Check for updates of macOS in /System Preferences/ > /Software Update/ (macOS <= 12) or /System Settings/ > /General/ > /Software Update/ (macOS >= 13).

** Xcode
   A full Xcode installation is not always needed. Most often, the Xcode Command Line Tools (CLT) are enough, for example for Homebrew. But some development software needs a full Xcode installation such as the FreePGI Fortran Compiler. So one can, for example, install the Xcode CLT only, and install the full Xcode only if another program demands it. Note that installing the full XCode takes considerable time (count rather half an hour or more).

   The normal way to install the XCode Command Line Tools (CLT) from the terminal would be:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     xcode-select --install
   #+END_SRC

   There is an glitch if you installed with /Software Update/ and had a full XCode installation: the XCode Command Line Tools do not get updated so that gfortran, for example, will clash with XCode's clang compiler. So I first uninstalled CLT and reinstalled them again:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
     sudo xcode-select --install
   #+END_SRC

   This still pointed to the compiler within the XCode app:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     xcode-select --print-path
     # /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/
   #+END_SRC

   This can be [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72428802/c-lang-llvm-option-parsing-unknown-command-line-argument-when-running-gfort][fixed]] by pointing to clang within the CLT:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     sudo xcode-select -switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
   #+END_SRC

   If you did a frech install, you might let Homebrew do the job, i.e. it will install the XCode Connad Line Tools if they are missing.

   The full Xcode can be installed from the App Store. You have to open it once and confirm the Usage Agreement in order to use the bundled tools. If you install Xcode, it is reasonable to complete the Xcode installation and the one-time opening before starting with [[#homebrew][Homebrew]]. Otherwise, it might install the command line tools CLT twice, but it costs only download bandwidth and time.

   While waiting for XCode to install, you can download and install the other apps from [[#app-store][App Store]], [[#xquartz][XQuartz]] and some [[#freeware][Freeware]] except [[http://www.chachatelier.fr/latexit/][LaTeXiT]] and [[https://www.sourcetreeapp.com][SourceTree]]. You can also [[#set-preferences-of-macos-and-standard-apps][Set preferences of macOS and standard apps]].

** Set preferences of macOS and standard apps
   Set /System Preferences/ (macOS <= 12) or /System Settings/ (macOS >= 13) such as:
   Check for updates of macOS in /System Preferences/ > /Software Update/ (macOS <= 12) or /System Settings/ > /General/ > /Software Update/ (macOS >= 13) .

   - Set computer name in /Sharing/ > /Computer Name/ or in /General/ > /Sharing/ > /Local hostname/

   - Unset all in /Mission Control/ or in /Desktop & Dock/ > /Mission Control/

   - Set /Keyboard/ > /Modifier Keys.../ > /Caps Lock Key/ to /No Action/ or set /Keyboard/ > /Keyboard Shortcuts/ > /Modifier Keys/ > /Caps Lock Key/ to /No Action/

   Set preferences/settings in standard macOS apps such as:
   - Terminal
     + Set /Profiles/ > /Shell/ > /When the shell exists:/ to /Close if the shell exited cleanly/

     + Unset tickbox /Profiles/ > /Advanced/ > /Set locale environment variables on startup/

   - Finder
     + Set tickbox /Advanced/ > /Show all filename extensions/

** Set the default shell
   Apple is now using /zsh/ as its default shell. If you want to stay with /bash/, change it in the terminal:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     chsh -s /bin/bash
   #+END_SRC

   To get rid of the nagging reminder that the default shell is now zsh every time you open a new terminal window, set in your =.bash_profile=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     export BASH_SILENCE_DEPRECATION_WARNING=1
   #+END_SRC

   My current =.bash_profile= is as dot-bash\under{}profile in this repository along with the two sub-config files =.bashrc= as dot-bashrc for general aliases and functions and =.bashrc.13= as dot-bashrc.13 for macOS 13 Ventura-specific aliases and functions.

** Restore backup
   If you did a fresh install, transfer files from your backup media either directly or using a Time Machine backup.

** App Store
   Even when you installed using /Software Update/, you should check for updates. Do not look only in /App Store.../ > /Updates/ but also on your account (on the bottom left) if there is an update. Xcode did not show up in /Updates/ for me but I had to update it from the account page.

   If you did a fresh install, check your account in the App Store. There are bundled apps such as Keynote, Numbers, etc., which you should open once to get over the welcome screens and offered tutorials.

   It also shows you a list of previously installed apps on other systems. Install what you still want and open it once.

   My essential apps from the App Store are:\\
   Keynote/Pages/Numbers, The Unarchiver, WordService, HiddenMe, Microsoft Remote Desktop, Engauge Digitizer.

** XQuartz
   XQuartz is the X-window system running on macOS, needed for \ast{}nix GUI programs. Get it from [[http://xquartz.macosforge.org/][XQuartz]].

** Homebrew
   Install [[http://brew.sh][Homebrew]] for easy \ast{}nix package installation.

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   #+END_SRC

   This installs Homebrew into =/usr/local= on macOS Intel and into =/opt/homebrew= on macOS Apple Silicon (M1, M2, etc.).

   You might want to put into your =.bash_profile= for macOS Intel:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     [[ -x $(which brew) ]] && eval $(brew shellenv)
   #+END_SRC

   and for macOS Apple Silicon (Mx):

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     [[ -d /opt/homebrew ]] && eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)
   #+END_SRC

   so that Homebrew can be found. This sets, for example, the environment variables =HOMEBREW_PREFIX=, =HOMEBREW_CELLAR=, and =HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY= and prepends the =$PATH= with Homebrew's bin directory. I set this manually because I want to have Homebrew's bin directory at the end rather than at the beginning of the system =$PATH= such as:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     if [[ -d /opt/homebrew ]] ; then
         # eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)
         # or by hand to append rather than prepand path
         export HOMEBREW_PREFIX="/opt/homebrew";
         export HOMEBREW_CELLAR="/opt/homebrew/Cellar";
         export HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY="/opt/homebrew";
         export PATH=${PATH}:/opt/homebrew/bin
     elif [[ -e /usr/local/bin/brew ]] ; then
         export HOMEBREW_PREFIX="/usr/local";
         export HOMEBREW_CELLAR="/usr/local/Cellar";
         export HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY="/usr/local";
         export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/bin
     fi
   #+END_SRC

   - *GNU compiler and netCDF software*

     The gcc suite includes /gfortran/. Install the netcdf-C version, which comes with /ncdump/, etc., install /nco/, /ncview/, and /Panoply/.
     Homebrew had netcdf-C, netcdf-C++, and netcdf-Fortran bundled in /netcdf/ before. They are individual packages now. /netcdf/ installs the netcdf-C package only now. See install\under{}netcdf below for Fortran support.
      One can also install /cdo/ with Homebrew. /cdo/ is, however, quite a bit faster when compiled with the Intel compiler and not with the GNU compiler as in Homebrew.

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       for i in ghostscript gcc netcdf cmake udunits proj jasper gsl ; do \
           brew install ${i} ; done
     #+END_SRC
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       for i in antlr@2 geos gdal nco ncview ; do brew install ${i} ; done
     #+END_SRC
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       brew install --cask temurin  # Java, for panoply
     #+END_SRC
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       brew install --cask panoply
     #+END_SRC
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       brew install cdo
     #+END_SRC

     /HDF5/ from Homebrew is not thread-safe so /cdo/ will need the -L flag if piping, i.e. more than one operator is given to /cdo/ in one call such as =cdo -timmean -selvar,Tair infile outfile=. I use in my =.bashrc=:

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       alias cdo="cdo -L"
     #+END_SRC

     Note that =cdo -L= instead of purely =cdo= must also be used in scripts for piping.

   - *Install more practical software*

     Some more practical software such as /wget/ for retrieval of files from web servers, /imagemagick/ for image manipulation, /ffmpeg/ for movies, /htop/ for an extended top, /pandoc/ to convert between markup languages, /fd/ for a faster find, /ripgrep/ for grepping across a directory tree, the statistical computing environment /R/, the version control system /subversion/, and the command-line fuzzy finder /fzf/:

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       for i in wget imagemagick ffmpeg enscript htop graphviz pkg-config \
            pandoc doxygen tree git fd bat ripgrep r subversion ; do \
            brew install ${i} ; done
     #+END_SRC
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       brew install fzf
     #+END_SRC
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       ${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/opt/fzf/install
     #+END_SRC

** Set your default shell #2
   Apple moved to /zsh/ because of the license change of /bash/ from GPLv2 to GPLv3 with its version 4.0. The current bash shell on macOS is hence 3.2 from 2007. If you want to use the latest version of /bash/, install it with Homebrew, "whitelist" the new shell as a login shell, and choose it as your default login shell:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     brew install bash
   #+END_SRC
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     # add the following line to /etc/shells
     # /usr/local/bin/bash
     # or
     # /opt/homebrew/bin/bash
     sudo nano /etc/shells
   #+END_SRC
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     chsh -s ${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/bin/bash
   #+END_SRC

   Note that your shell scripts will probably still use the Apple default bash shell because they often have the shebang line =#!/bin/bash=. The most portable way to write shell scripts is to use =#!/usr/bin/env bash= as your shebang. This will take the first /bash/ in your =$PATH=, which would now be =/usr/local/bin/bash= or =/opt/homebrew/bin/bash=.

   You can now use /bash-completion/ with the new bash shell.

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     brew install bash-completion@2
   #+END_SRC

   You then have to put the following lines in your =.bash_profile= to use bash-completion:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     if [[ -f "${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh" ]] ; then
         export BASH_COMPLETION_COMPAT_DIR="${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/etc/bash_completion.d"
         source "${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh"
     fi
   #+END_SRC

   Note that these lines have to be after the sourcing of =.fzf.bash= in your =.bash_profile= if you installed /fzf/, otherwise you get an error such as =programmable_completion: source: possible retry loop=.

   You can do the exact same steps for the zsh shell. Apples version of /zsh/ is rather new but if you want to have the newest developments, install /zsh/ with Homebrew, whitelist it and use it as your default shell. If you use /zsh/, you might want to check out [[https://ohmyz.sh][Oh My ZSH]] for easy configuration of /zsh/.

   After a system update such as from /System Preferences/ > /Software Update/, there might be a link =Relocated Items/= on your Desktop pointing to =/Users/Shared/Relocated Items=. This is a copy of the changed =/etc/shells=. As long as Apple does not modify =/etc/shells= during an update, the edited version stays untouched, though. One can safely delete the link on the Desktop and also the directory under =/Users/Shared=. It does not hurt to do a =cat /etc/shells= in the terminal before, checking that your edits are still there.

** Emacs
   I used to use [[http://aquamacs.org][Aquamacs]], but use [[https://www.spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]] now. The latter is very fast, but has a steep learning curve. At the moment I am not using the two most praised modes: helm and evil. I also needed quite some configuration in the =dotspacemacs/user-config= section of =.spacemacs.= My current .spacemacs is as dot-spacemacs in this repository.

   To install Spacemacs, install Emacs first:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     brew install --cask emacs
   #+END_SRC

   If you have an older Spacemacs version, backup your .spacemacs, check for locally installed themes or other packages (Untracked files), and backup .emacs.d:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     cd ${HOME}
     if [[ -f .spacemacs ]] ; then mv .spacemacs .spacemacs.bak ; fi
     if [[ -d .emacs.d ]] ; then
         cd .emacs.d
         git status
         cd ..
         mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.bak
     fi
   #+END_SRC

   And if you changed from another Emacs, backup .emacs and .emacs.d:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     cd ${HOME}
     if [[ -f .emacs ]] ; then mv .emacs .emacs.bak ; fi
     if [[ -d .emacs.d ]] ; then mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.bak ; fi
   #+END_SRC

   Then install the new Spacemacs (i.e. a new emacs.d):

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
   #+END_SRC

   and copy any locally installed files from .emacs.d.bak to .emacs.d.

   I also installed the font [[https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro][Source Code Pro]]:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
     brew install --cask homebrew/cask-fonts/font-source-code-pro
   #+END_SRC

   And I immediately installed aspell for spell checking within Spacemacs, and the GNU version of tar (new requirement since Emacs 28.2).

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     brew install aspell gnu-tar
   #+END_SRC

   If you open the new Emacs for the first time, it will install and byte-compile more than 200 packages. This might take some time. But you will be asked at least one confirmation in-between.

   The first opening will also produce a new .spacemacs. Compare it with the .spacemacs.bak and add your layers and user sections. The next opening of Emacs will probably compile another 100 packages or so.

   Spacemacs could not access external disks on my systems (Catalina 10.15.7, Big Sur 11.5.1, Monterey 12.0.1) because it did not have the right permissions. I had to give /Full Disk Access/ to =/usr/bin/ruby=.
   Before macOS 13 Ventura, I was following [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/53026/how-to-restore-file-system-access-in-macos-catalina/53037#53037][this]]: Open /System Preferences/ -> /Security & Privacy/ -> /Privacy/, select /Full Disk Access/ in the left pane. From macOS 13 Ventura, it is /System Preferences/ > /Privacy & Security/ > /Full Disk Access/. Then click + and add =/usr/bin/ruby= to resolve the issue. =/usr= is hidden by default on macOS but you can toggle visibility in /Finder/ by using =Shift+Command+Period=, i.e. =Shift+Command+.=

** LaTeX
   One can download LaTeX from [[https://tug.org/mactex/][MacTeX]] or use a Homebrew cask. I have chosen Homebrew's cask this time because I use the BasicTeX installation and I hope that Homebrew will handle the update between years, which is always a hassle otherwise; but I do not know yet if Homebrew will handle it. The full MacTex installation including all GUIs, Apps, and Programs is:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     brew install --cask mactex
   #+END_SRC

   The minimal LaTeX installation is:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     brew install --cask basictex
   #+END_SRC

   If you chose BasicTeX, then some common LaTeX packages can be installed with:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     sudo tlmgr update --self ; \

   I also install LaTeXML so that Emacs' org-mode can convert LaTeX equations to MathML on export:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     brew install latexml

** Myriad Pro
   I like the Myriad Pro font and AGU journals currently use it. The Myriad Pro font comes with the Adobe Acrobat Reader.

   To install for non-LaTeX programs, one can install in Font Book the four /otf/-files from the directory '/Applications/Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.app/Contents/Resources/Resource/Font'.

   An extended set of glyphs are given in the zip file 'MyriadPro.zip':\\
   unzip MyriadPro.zip and drag the folder with the .otf files into Font Book.

   To install Myriad Pro for LaTeX, using the Adobe fonts, one can launch the following commands in terminal:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     for i in fontinst fltpoint tabfigures mnsymbol mdsymbol \
         collection-fontutils ; do \
         sudo tlmgr install ${i} ; done
     git clone https://github.com/sebschub/FontPro.git
     cd FontPro
     mkdir otf
     FONT=MyriadPro
     cp "/Applications/Adobe Acrobat Reader.app/Contents/Resources/Resource/Font/"${FONT}*.otf otf/
     ./scripts/makeall ${FONT}
     echo y | sudo ./scripts/install
     sudo updmap-sys --enable Map=${FONT}.map
     sudo -H mktexlsr
     kpsewhich ${FONT}.map
     cd ..
     \rm -fr FontPro
   #+END_SRC

** Python

   macOS Catalina (10.15) still comes with Python version 2.7.16 as its default version. Official support for Python 2 has ended Januar 2020. So you want to install Python 3. From macOS Big Sur (11.5) onwards, macOS comes with Python 3 (from macOS 13 Ventura, is is actually part of the XCode command line tools). But I still recommend to install Python with /pyenv/ and /pyenv-virtualenv/: you can install different Python versions, very easily use different virtual environments in different directories (projects), etc.

   Installation of Python versions can be a real mess at times, as noted by [[https://xkcd.com/1987/][XKCD]]:

   #+ATTR_HTML: :alt Python path on my system :align center :width 300 :height 300
   [[https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png]]

   /pyenv/ and /pyenv-virtualenv/ makes that very easy: see the great article [[https://medium.com/faun/pyenv-multi-version-python-development-on-mac-578736fb91aa][pyenv: Multi-version Python development on Mac]] by Dirk Avery.

   To install pyenv with Homebrew:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib
     brew install pyenv
     brew install pyenv-virtualenv
   #+END_SRC

   You have to set the following in your =.bash_profile= so that the shell always finds the currently chosen Python version as the first entry.

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     export PYENV_ROOT="${HOME}/.pyenv"
     export PATH=${PYENV_ROOT}/shims:${PATH}
     if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1 ; then eval "$(pyenv init -)" ; fi
     if command -v pyenv virtualenv-init 1>/dev/null 2>&1 ; then eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)" ; fi
   #+END_SRC

   Note that the =$PATH= environment must be prepended with =${PYENV_ROOT}/shims= and not =${PYENV_ROOT}/bin= as given in the (older) user guide. Also, this has to be done /after/ the addition of Homebrew to the system =$PATH= so that the pyenv Python installation can be found first; otherwise Homebrew's Python will be found first.

   - *pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv 101*

     After starting a new shell, for example by doing =exec ${SHELL}=, you can start installing and using different Python versions:

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       pyenv install --list
       pyenv install 3.10.9
       pyenv rehash
       pyenv global 3.10.9
     #+END_SRC

     Remember that you always have to /rehash/ after you installed a new version or new virtual environment.

     Try to rehash first if a problem occurs with /pyenv/. For example, some new Homebrew packages might upgrade /pyenv/ as well. Then you get an error such as

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       /Users/cuntz/.pyenv/shims/python: line 21:
       /usr/local/Cellar/pyenv/2.3.12/libexec/pyenv:
       No such file or directory
     #+END_SRC

     =pyenv rehash= resolves the issue.

     Note that I actually install Python versions currently as follows:

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       brew install tcl-tk
     #+END_SRC
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS=" \
           --with-tcltk-includes='-I${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/opt/tcl-tk/include' \
           --with-tcltk-libs='-L${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/opt/tcl-tk/lib -ltcl8.6 -ltk8.6' \
           --enable-optimizations --enable-framework=${HOME}/Library/Frameworks" \
           CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix xz)/include" \
           LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix xz)/lib" \
           PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$(brew --prefix xz)/lib/pkgconfig" \
           pyenv install 3.10.9
     #+END_SRC
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       pyenv rehash
     #+END_SRC

     This uses the newer Tcl/Tk version from Homebrew for /tkinter/, turns on profile guided optimization and link time optimization for Python being about 10% faster, and enables a framework build. Optimization takes significantly more time to install Python. If you do not use /tkinter/ and just want to try out a Python version, =pyenv install 3.10.9= is just fine. Otherwise I recommend the optimization because you do not install Python too often but get a significant gain. Python has to be a framework (=--enable-framework=) if /wxPython/ is used (see the [[https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki][pyenv wiki]] for details). This needs administrator rights since macOS 13 (Ventura). Each installation of packages, creation of virtual environments, etc. will need sudo then. This is a nuisance. So I rather install the framework in my local Library folder (~--enable-framework=${HOME}/Library/Frameworks~). This only works with pyenv version >= 2.3.12, otherwise it fails due to a bug in pyenv.

     Virtual environments are created as:

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       pyenv virtualenv 3.10.9 test
       pyenv rehash
     #+END_SRC

     The virtual environment /test/ can then be used just as any installed Python version with /pyenv/. For example:
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       pyenv local testproject
     #+END_SRC

     /pyenv/ provides also /anaconda/ and /miniconda/, with which you can use conda environments:

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       pyenv install miniconda3-4.7.12
       pyenv rehash
       pyenv global miniconda3-4.7.12
       pyenv virtualenv test
     #+END_SRC

     You can then install (conda and pip) packages in the test nproject, etc.:

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       conda install numpy scipy matplotlib
     #+END_SRC

     If git tells /gettext not found/ after installing anaconda/miniconda, see [[https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup][Nicolas Hery]].

   - *Essential Python packages*

     Anaconda comes with hundreds of packages. I tend to use either an official Python version or miniconda and install my essential packages with /pip/ or /conda/mamba/. These are currently in my main environment:\\
     numpy, scipy, matplotlib, cartopy, ipython, jupyter, pandas, cftime, netcdf4, udunits, statsmodels, scikit-learn, xlrd, openpyxl, mpi4py, schwimmbad, xarray, numpydoc, pytest, pytest-cov, flake8, gdal, f90nml, pykdtree, cython, pyshp, six, wheel

     and mostly this subset in other virtual environments:\\
     numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, netcdf4, xarray, ipython, flake8, wheel

     You would have to source your =.bash_profile= again if you install with /pip/ or /conda/ just after installing /pyenv/.

     There is currently a problem with Apple's Accelerate framework on Apple Silicon (M1/2) so that one should use /OpenBLAS/. You also need to tell /pip/ where to find the HDF5 library and the GEOS library and the like. You do not need the lines with =OPENBLAS= and =HDF5-DIR= if you are on macOS on Intel and Homebrew installs into =/usr/local=; this directory is searched automatically.

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       # essential subset
       if [[ "$(uname -m)" == "arm64" ]] ; then
           export OPENBLAS="$(brew --prefix openblas)"
           export HDF5_DIR="$(brew --prefix hdf5)"
           export GEOS_DIR="$(brew --prefix geos)"
           export GEOS_CONFIG="$(brew --prefix geos)/bin/geos-config"
       fi
       pyenv virtualenv 3.10.9 pystd
       pyenv rehash
       pyenv global pystd
       pyenv rehash
       # test if install works
       python -m pip install numpy
       for i in wheel scipy matplotlib ipython pandas netcdf4 \
           xarray ipython flake8 ; do \
           python -m pip install ${i} ; done
       # other standard packages
       for i in jupyter statsmodels scikit-learn schwimmbad \
           numpydoc pytest pytest-cov f90nml pykdtree cython pyshp six \
           xlrd openpyxl ; do \
           python -m pip install ${i} ; done
       # shapely and gdal for cartopy
       # shapely needs to be built from source to link to geos.
       # Uninstall it if already installed
       [[ -z $(python -m pip freeze | grep shapely) ]] && python -m pip uninstall -y shapely
       python -m pip install shapely --no-binary shapely
       # gdal needs to know the installed gdal version
       python -m pip install GDAL==$(gdal-config --version) \
           --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/include"
       python -m pip install cartopy
       # basemap is back in development again :-)
       python -m pip install basemap-data
       python -m pip install basemap-data-hires
       python -m pip install basemap
       # mpi4py will be installed after installing openmpi later
       # if you use GUIs written in wxpython
       CXXFLAGS="-I${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/include" python -m pip install wxpython
     #+END_SRC

     Replace /python -m pip/ with /conda/ if using conda environments or install mamba first and the use /mamba/ instead of /pip.

** locate
   Create locate database so that you can search files with the locate command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist
   #+END_SRC

   This might already be running (Operation already in progress) if you upgraded via /System Update/.

** Payware
   Install Payware, which is for me:
   - Microsoft Office,

   - [[https://www.antidote.info/en][Antidote]], spell and grammar checker for English and French,

   - [[http://www.nag.co.uk/downloads/npdownloads.asp][NAG compiler]], very meticulous Fortran compiler,

   - [[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html][Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit]] and [[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html][Intel oneAPI HPC Toolkit]], C/C++/Fortran compiler producing very fast code,

   - [[https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/][CyberGhost]], VPN client,

   - [[https://www.harrisgeospatial.com/Software-Technology/IDL][IDL]], interactive data language.

** Additional software
   Install additional software from you institution or similar such as VPN clients, cloud services, etc. For INRAE this is: Kaspersky Antivirus, GlobalProtect VPN, StorageMadeEasy.

** netcdf4\under{}fortran and openmpi development packages
   You can install [[https://downloads.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/][netcdf-fortran]] for the gfortran compiler.

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     brew install netcdf-fortran
   #+END_SRC

   This will automatically update netcdf-fortran for gfortran if a newer version of netcdf-C and/or netcdf-fortran becomes available.

   However, if you use other Fortran compilers as well, you might want to use the script [[https://github.com/mcuntz/install_netcdf][install\under{}netcdf]] to install it and not flood your namespace with different versions of =netcdf.mod=, etc. The script [[https://github.com/mcuntz/install_netcdf][install\under{}netcdf]] installs netcdf-fortran, openmpi, and/or mpich development packages for different Fortran compilers. The script is well documented and we just describe the general steps.

   - Look for the latest versions (numbers) of [[https://downloads.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/][netcdf-fortran]], [[https://www.open-mpi.org][openmpi]], and/or [[http://www.mpich.org/downloads/][mpich]] (addresses are also given at the beginning of the script install\under{}netcdf) and set them below /donetcdf4\under{}fortran/, /doopenmpi/, and/or /dompich/.

   - Set /donetcdf4\under{}fortran/, /doopenmpi/, and/or /dompich/ to 1.

   - Check that ~prefix=/usr/local~.

   - Set Fortran compiler, e.g. ~fortran_compilers="gfortran"~.

   - For Intel, you need to source the compiler setup script such as:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
   #+END_SRC

   - For PGI, you also have to set the ~pgipath~.

   - Run he script on the command line and give your sudo password if you install into ~prefix=/usr/local~.

   After having installed /openmpi/, one can also install /mpi4py/ in Python, for example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     env MPICC=/usr/local/openmpi-4.1.4-gfortran/bin/mpicc python -m pip install mpi4py
   #+END_SRC

   However, homebrew upgrades also netcdf-C to newer versions if you install or update a package that depends on it. Then the netcdf-fortran package installed with install\under{}netcdf will not work anymore (it will link to the old, uninstalled version) and you have to rerun the script [[https://github.com/mcuntz/install_netcdf][install\under{}netcdf]]. I still do it this way to minimize conflicts between different Fortran compilers and re-installing netcdf-fortran with install\under{}netcdf is very fast.
